title: TestShift
subtitle: A radical shift in the testing mindset
---

We are looking for awesome colleagues to join our team as PhD Students or Post-Docs! Find out more about our vacancies [here](/vacancies).

The goal of TestShift is to understand and radically change how software engineers consider their testing activities.  
We want to understand their considerations, the trade-offs they make when deciding (not) to test (anymore).  
This complex matter is likely not the decision of an individual, but rather originating from a set of complex socio-technical circumstances.  
With the help of very specialised test analytics, TestShift aims to inform developers and development teams of their testing efforts and indicate potential shortfalls, with the aim of steering software developing organisations to test more effectively and efficiently.  

Find out more about our first PhD project around [visualizing amplified test cases](/visualizing-amplification)!  
TestShift is a research project of the [Software Engineering Research Group](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/) at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and funded by an NWO Vici grant.
